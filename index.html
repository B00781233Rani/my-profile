			<h3> Passions & Interests</h3>
			<h2>Philosophy</h2>
			<p>
				I am passionate about Philosophy and socio-cultural studies. Nothing captivates me more than pondering the meaning or importance of ideas, traditions, and beliefs in our society. Questions that have importance, character, and shape our way of life interest me, as I feel as though I am tackling, and partaking in, something of significance and worthy.
			</p>
			<h2>History</h2>
			<p>					
				Much like my passion for philosophy, my love of history is derived from a deep desire to better understand ourselves and our society. Observing our ancestors, grants me unique insight into who we are as human beings and why undertake certain endeavors and actions. Furthermore, Studying history allows us to observe and understand how people and societies behaved. For example, we are able to evaluate war, even when a nation is at peace, by looking back at previous events. History provides us with the data that is used to create laws, or theories about various aspects of society.
				</p>
				<h2>Politics</h2>
				<p>
					Politics affect every aspect of your life. What are most indivduals concerned about? The economy, the unemployment rate, and income tax structure are always the top reasons. Then there are social issues such as civil rights, abortion, religious rights, foreign policy, legal interpretation, healthcare, the environment, and so on. Politics govern every aspect of our lives and I want to not only be engaged in the discussion, but involve myself in the solutions.
